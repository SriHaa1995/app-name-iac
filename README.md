Develop Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allowing a 2-tier architected application (web and database tiers) to be provisioned. Consider high  availability (HA),  fault  tolerance,  scalability,  security .

1. Infrastructure Overview

	•	Web Tier: An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to ensure high availability and scalability for the application.
	•	Database Tier: An Amazon RDS instance in a Multi-AZ setup to provide high availability and fault tolerance for the database.

2. Terraform Code Structure

	•	Organize Terraform code into modules for each layer (e.g., web, database, network).
	•	Use variables to parameterize aspects like instance types, VPC configurations, and security settings.

3. Networking and Security

	•	VPC: Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
	•	Subnets: Public subnets for the web tier and private subnets for the database tier.
	•	Security Groups: Set up security groups to allow traffic between web and database tiers only through specific ports (e.g., 443 for HTTPS traffic to web, and 3306 for MySQL database connections).
	•	Network ACLs: Add network ACLs for an extra layer of security.

4. High Availability and Fault Tolerance

	•	Web Tier: Deploy instances in an ASG across multiple AZs with ELB in front. ELB will distribute incoming traffic and automatically redirect it to healthy instances, ensuring fault tolerance.
	•	Database Tier: Use RDS in a Multi-AZ configuration, which automatically replicates data to a standby instance in another AZ. In case of failure, RDS will failover to the standby.

5. Scalability

	•	Auto Scaling: Configure the ASG with scaling policies based on CPU utilization or request count to automatically add/remove instances.
	•	RDS Read Replicas (if required): Set up read replicas for scaling read operations if the application experiences high database read traffic.

6. Security Considerations

	•	IAM Roles: Assign IAM roles with least-privilege permissions to instances for secure access to other AWS resources.
	•	Encryption: Enable encryption at rest and in transit for RDS and ensure SSL/TLS for the web application.
	•	Secrets Management: Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store to manage sensitive data like database credentials.

7. Additional Considerations

	•	Logging and Monitoring: Enable CloudWatch monitoring for metrics and logs. Set up alarms for critical metrics (e.g., high CPU utilization or database connectivity issues).
	•	Backups: Enable automated backups for RDS and set up snapshot schedules as part of a disaster recovery plan.
	•	Infrastructure State Management: Use Terraform Cloud or a remote backend (like an S3 bucket with state locking via DynamoDB) for state management.
